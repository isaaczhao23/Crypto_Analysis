Use update_coin_list_Rda.Rmd if you want to update the history data file to today's date. ~15 min to update.



The first field in generate_comparison is the reference price on the specified date you want all other dates to compare to. 
    This can only take a maximum of the date from the last date update_coin_list_Rda.Rmd was run. Currently max is Feb 10, 2018.

The second field is the number of months in the past you want to compare to.

The third field can take values:
    "name" = sorts dataset by coin name.
    "marketcap" = sorts dataset by marketcap (descending).
    "percent" = sorts each column of dataset by the coin with the highest gain since that month.

View(output)
sjPlot::tab_df(output, title = "Cryptocurrencies With the Highest Gains for Each Month Compared to Februrary 10, 2018", alternate.rows=TRUE )
