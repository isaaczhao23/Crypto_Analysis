## To compare which coins have the highest gains on average compared to other coins:
1a. (OPTIONAL) If you want the most up to date data, run update_coin_list_Rda.Rmd. Updating takes about 15 min. Otherwise, most recent data is from Feb 10, 2018. 

1b. (OPTIONAL) If you want to compare more than the top 20 coins, change the "20" to whatever rank you want in the filter code line 12 in update_coin_list_Rda.Rmd. Then run the file.

2. Open and run all code chunks from compare_coin_histories.Rmd.
